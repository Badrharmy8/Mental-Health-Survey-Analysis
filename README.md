# Mental Health Survey Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project explores mental health among working individuals across different industries and regions.  
The goal is to analyze factors affecting employeesâ€™ mental health and identify patterns or issues that could help organizations improve workplace environments and provide better mental health support.  

This analysis is focused on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, highlighting initial insights and trends in the dataset. A deeper analysis can be performed in the next stage.

## ðŸ“Œ Dataset Overview
- **Rows:** 3,157  
- **Columns:** 14  

The dataset contains demographic, work-related, and health information for employees. Key columns include:  
- Age, Gender, Region, Industry, Job Role  
- Work Arrangement, Hours per Week, Salary Range  
- Mental Health Status, Burnout Level, Work-Life Balance Score  
- Physical Health Issues, Social Isolation Score

## ðŸ“Œ Data Quality Issues
- **Missing Values:**  
  - `Mental_Health_Status`: 25% â†’ filled with `"Prefer not to say"`  
  - `Physical_Health_Issues`: 9% â†’ interpreted as no physical health issues
- **Duplicates:** None  
- **Data Types:** `Survey_Date` converted from object to `datetime`

## ðŸ“Œ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
1. **Survey Date:** Converted to `datetime` format.  
2. **Categorical Encoding:** Converted object columns to category type for memory efficiency.  
3. **Mental Health Status:** Missing values filled with `"Prefer Not To Say"`.  
4. **Physical Health Issues:** Split into separate binary columns:  
   - `Back_Pain`, `Shoulder_Pain`, `Neck_Pain`, `Eye_Strain`, `Wrist_Pain`  
   - Additional column `Physical_Health_Missing` tracks missing values.
